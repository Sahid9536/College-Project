                   <p>  Organic farming system in India is not new and is being followed from ancient time. It is a method
                     of farming system which primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such a way, as
                     to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes (crop, animal and farm wastes,
                     aquatic wastes) and other biological materials along with beneficial microbes (biofertilizers) to
                     release nutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in an eco friendly pollution free
                     environment. <br><br>
         
                     As per the definition of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) study team on organic
                     farming “organic farming is a system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs
                     (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and to the maximum extent feasible
                     rely upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade rock
                     additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection”. <br><br>
         
                     FAO suggested that “Organic agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and
                     enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological
                     activity, and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic, biological and mechanical methods in
                     exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs”.
